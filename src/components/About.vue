          <h4>Our favourite rooms</h4>
          <p>
            Standard king rooms here are so large they’d be junior suites at a
            lesser hotel; each has an array of cosy sofas in addition to the
            enormous bed, so you won’t lack places to flop after a hard day
            lounging in the sun. The vaguely Moorish-inspired decor in neutral
            tones is pleasingly relaxing, too. If you’d like a private terrace,
            too, opt for a junior suite.

          <h4>Swimming Pool</h4>
          <p>
            Take a dip in the temperature-controlled outdoor pool, which
            overlooks the Persian Gulf. Expect your drinks to be whisked to your
            lounger instantaneously, and your sunglasses to be meticulously
            polished as soon as you set them down. The heated outdoor pool is
            family-friendly and supervised by a lifeguard.
